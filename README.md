## Chat client
A client component of a chat service, meant to communicate with a separate chat- and name server.
The chat client sends packets from a given set of Protocol Data Units (PDU) over a TCP peer-to-peer connetion to each of these separate servers for messages, joining and leaving the chat etc.
The client itself is run through the commmand-line where all avaliable chats servers, sent/received messages and usernames will be displayed.
